This exercise is particularly crucial for Christian believers who seek to walk faithfully before God and actively serve Him. Proverbs 4:23 provides this directive: “Guard your heart above all else, for it determines the course of your life.” There are four key reasons why Christians ought to diligently evaluate what their lives are built on:\nTo ensure alignment with Biblical values To identify areas requiring repentance and growth To refocus and strengthen faith in Christ Jesus To ensure a faithful witness unto others Ensure Alignment With Biblical Values Firstly, Christians need to assess the foundations of their lives in order to maintain consistent fidelity to biblical principles. By constantly examining how their actions, motivations, and priorities align with the teachings of Scripture, believers can ensure they remain true to the Lord’s instructions and His will for their lives. When individuals understand that God’s Word serves as their blueprint for living righteously, the significance of ongoing self-evaluation becomes evident.\nIdentify Areas Requiring Repentance And Growth Secondly, evaluation allows Christians to recognize aspects of their lives that may be marred by sin or immature behavior. In such cases, appropriate steps can be taken towards repentance and growth, which are essential elements of the believer's spiritual journey. Continual improvement hinges upon identifying those areas within oneself needing transformation in light of God's Word, leading ultimately towards greater holiness and obedience.\nRefocus And Strengthen Faith In Christ Jesus Thirdly, evaluating one's life helps believers refocus attention upon their relationship with Christ Jesus as its cornerstone. As followers navigate through the complexities of daily life encounters, it becomes increasingly necessary to revisit their reliance on God's grace, protection, wisdom, comfort, and guidance. Regular assessment ensures Christians remain centered on Christ while navigating evolving circumstances and challenges. This focus allows them to grow deeper in their faith and intimacy with God.\nEnsure A Faithful Witness Unto Others Lastly, when Christians consistently scrutinize the principles governing their lives, they model integrity and self-awareness. This practice serves as a powerful testimony for others observing their faith journey—whether unsaved family members, friends, co-workers or strangers encountered in everyday life settings. In an era characterized by skepticism toward traditional morality and religious ideals, demonstrating genuine personal accountability bolsters credibility within secular circles and heightens respect for Christianity among unbelievers.\nIn summary, evaluating what our lives are built on carries profound importance for Christians striving to live faithfully according to God’s Word. It promotes adherence to scriptural tenets, identifies areas requiring repentance and growth, deepens one’s trust in Christ Jesus as the foundation of their existence, and testifies to the transformative power of salvation in the eyes of those outside the faith. Guarding one’s heart by regularly assessing life’s components proves pivotal for all believers seeking to honor God in all aspects of their lives.\n","wordCount":"495","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2024-03-07T16:40:10Z","dateModified":"2024-03-07T16:40:10Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://zakturner.github.io/posts/18446587-why-should-christians-evaluate-what-their-lives-are-built-on/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Zak Turner","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://zakturner.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://zakturner.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Zak Turner (Alt + H)">Zak Turner</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Why Should Christians Evaluate What Their Lives Are Built On?</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2024-03-07 16:40:10 +0000 UTC'>March 7, 2024</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;3 min</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><ul><li><a href=# aria-label="Ensure Alignment With Biblical Values">Ensure Alignment With Biblical Values</a></li><li><a href=# aria-label="Identify Areas Requiring Repentance And Growth">Identify Areas Requiring Repentance And Growth</a></li><li><a href=# aria-label="Refocus And Strengthen Faith In Christ Jesus">Refocus And Strengthen Faith In Christ Jesus</a></li><li><a href=# aria-label="Ensure A Faithful Witness Unto Others">Ensure A Faithful Witness Unto Others</a></li></ul></div></details></div><div class=post-content><p>In a world where truth and wisdom are often blurred by selfishness, deception, or apathy, it is critical for every person to regularly examine the fundamental building blocks of their lives.
