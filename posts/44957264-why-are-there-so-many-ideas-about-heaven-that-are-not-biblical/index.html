This article aims to explore why there are so many non-biblically sound ideas about heaven. Some contributing factors include the influence of paganism, Platonic philosophy, Gnosticism, the liminal nature of heavenly concepts, cultural syncretism, the historical development of Christian eschatology, individual interpretations, and sectarian movements. While Scripture provides the primary foundation for Christian understanding of heaven, these factors have contributed significantly to various misconceptions about its nature.\nInfluence of Paganism Pagan beliefs surrounding an afterlife can be traced back to ancient Mesopotamian, Egyptian, Greek, Roman, Persian, and Norse cultures. Many early Christians were originally exposed to pagan teachings due to their cultural milieu before conversion, which could result in carrying over some erroneous beliefs concerning heaven. Pagan influences tended to emphasize heaven as a place primarily concerned with material rewards or punishments rather than focusing on God's character or relationships.\nPlatonic Philosophy Plato’s idealistic philosophies had a profound influence on early Christianity due to his connection with several Christian apologists like Justin Martyr and Origen. Conceptually borrowing from Plato, some Christians began to understand heaven as being composed of perfect, spiritual entities while earth represented the imperfect physical realm. However, this thinking was sometimes inconsistent with biblical descriptions emphasizing resurrection rather than mere disembodied existence.\nGnosticism Gnosticism was a widespread dualistic belief system that flourished in the first few centuries CE. It taught two separate realms: a lower spiritual realm created by an inferior deity (Yaldabaoth) and a superior spiritual realm belonging to a higher true God from which all good originated. Some Christian groups infiltrated by Gnostic thought associated heaven with the realm of pure spirit rather than acknowledging its connection to Jesus Christ’s earthly ministry and future cosmic redemption plans. This distorted view led to underestimating Jesus' central role in salvation history.\nLiminal Nature of Heavenly Concepts Heavenly ideas straddle two realities—the tangible world we experience and the transcendent realm beyond comprehension. Their intangibility makes them susceptible to misinterpretation based on existing cognitive models derived from human experience or prevailing ideologies. As a result, some attempt to articulate heavenly realities may unintentionally adopt aspects foreign to Bible teaching.\nCultural Syncretism Cultural syncretism describes how different cultures intermingle during contact resulting in hybrid beliefs and practices. Early Christians often interacted extensively with other faith communities which left room for certain beliefs about heaven potentially influenced by these encounters. For instance, the tradition linking the bibilical term \"new Jerusalem\" to images of a celestial city likely owes some debt to Mesopotamian ziggurats or the Greco-Roman idealized city.\nHistorical Development of Christian Eschatology Christian eschatology—study of end times events—has seen many shifts throughout church history. For example, millennialist interpretations (either premillennalist expecting Jesus' return before a thousand years period on Earth or postmillennial expecting Christ's return after a golden age) clashed with amillennialist views (a single end time event without divisions). These diverse perspectives have made for fluidity in doctrinal statements concerning heavenly destiny affecting how people perceived its nature and location.\nIndividual Interpretations Individual experiences shape the interpretation of religious texts differently across time and space. People from distinct socio-cultural backgrounds could arrive at differing conclusions regarding heavenly descriptions given varying modes of engaging scripture. Personal spiritual leanings towards contemplative asceticism or activist social engagement might lead individuals to favor apocalyptic or universalistic theories of the afterlife respectively.\nSectarian Movements Throughout church history, numerous sectarian groups have emerged either splitting from mainstream churches or arising independently holding their unique views about salvation and eternity. Some groups such as Spiritualists and the Jehovah's Witnesses have markedly divergent beliefs regarding heaven predicated upon idiosyncratic readings of biblical passages or rejection of traditional creeds.\nIn conclusion, multiple factors contribute to non-Biblically sound ideas about heaven pervading our cultural imagination. Acknowledging these influences does not diminish the divine revelation provided within Scripture but serves as a reminder to study Scripture prayerfully with discernment and humility amidst ongoing conversations shaped by diverse perspectives through the ages.\n","wordCount":"672","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2024-03-08T13:07:06Z","dateModified":"2024-03-08T13:07:06Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://zakturner.github.io/posts/44957264-why-are-there-so-many-ideas-about-heaven-that-are-not-biblical/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Zak Turner","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://zakturner.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://zakturner.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Zak Turner (Alt + H)">Zak Turner</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Why Are There So Many Ideas about Heaven That Are Not Biblical?</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2024-03-08 13:07:06 +0000 UTC'>March 8, 2024</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;4 min</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><ul><li><a href=# aria-label="Influence of Paganism">Influence of Paganism</a></li><li><a href=# aria-label="Platonic Philosophy">Platonic Philosophy</a></li><li><a href=# aria-label=Gnosticism>Gnosticism</a></li><li><a href=# aria-label="Liminal Nature of Heavenly Concepts">Liminal Nature of Heavenly Concepts</a></li><li><a href=# aria-label="Cultural Syncretism">Cultural Syncretism</a></li><li><a href=# aria-label="Historical Development of Christian Eschatology">Historical Development of Christian Eschatology</a></li><li><a href=# aria-label="Individual Interpretations">Individual Interpretations</a></li><li><a href=# aria-label="Sectarian Movements">Sectarian Movements</a></li></ul></div></details></div><div class=post-content><p>The idea of heaven permeates our cultural and religious imaginations, but many conceptions of it are not based on biblical texts.
